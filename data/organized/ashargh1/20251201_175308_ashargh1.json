        "The code first loads the MDN model trained with Gaussian-Noise sampling, evaluates it on the testing dataset, computes the R2 score, and prints the result.",
        "It then loads the MDN model trained with WERCS sampling, evaluates it on the same testing dataset, computes the R2 score, and prints the result",
        "The printed outputs show that the Gaussian-Noise model has an R2 of 0.98, whereas the WERCS-trained model has an R2 of 0.95, thereby confirming the claim that the WERCS model achieves a lower R2 score on the same testing dataset."
