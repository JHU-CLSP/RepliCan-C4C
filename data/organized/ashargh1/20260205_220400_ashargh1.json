The notebook loads the tensile stress–strain data from W-32.dat and applies the 0.2% offset method by drawing a line starting at a strain of 0.002, with a slope equal to the elastic modulus obtained from the linear elastic region of the stress–strain curve. The offset line and the stress–strain curves are plotted together",
