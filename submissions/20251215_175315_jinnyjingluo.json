The solid lines represent the predicted mean dislocation density, while the shaded regions indicate the associated uncertainty bounds. The experimental data points for both grain sizes clearly fall within the predicted uncertainty range throughout the strain range, demonstrating that the MDN model effectively captures both the trend and the variability of dislocation evolution across different grain sizes, in excellent agreement with the experimental results.
