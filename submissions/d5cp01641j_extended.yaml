    8. Expected output: Coordination analysis confirms monocapped trigonal prism at coordinates 1 and 19, pentagonal bipyramid at coordinates 10, 28, and 37 for both charge states. Successful analysis shows consistent polyhedral identification. Failed analysis shows different coordination patterns or inconsistent geometries between charge states.'


- claim: "In agreement with the Kepert model, the energetically preferred, i.e., lowest energy, heptacoordination type is the pentagonal bipyramid. The monocapped trigonal prism and monocapped octahedron polyhedra are still 'accessible' but non-preferred."
  instruction: '1. Required input files: CsPbBr3 configurations with PbBr7 complexes in different coordination geometries, DFT energy calculation parameters.
    
    2. Create model PbBr7 complexes with three different heptacoordinate geometries: pentagonal bipyramid, monocapped trigonal prism, and monocapped octahedron.
    
    3. Embed each geometry type in CsPbBr3 supercell environment maintaining realistic local structure.
    
    4. Perform structural relaxation calculations for each coordination type while constraining overall geometry.
    
    5. Calculate total energies for each heptacoordinate configuration.
    
    6. Compare relative energies to determine energetic preference order.
    
    7. Verify that pentagonal bipyramid shows lowest energy consistent with Kepert model predictions.
    
    8. Expected output: Energy ordering shows pentagonal bipyramid < monocapped trigonal prism ≈ monocapped octahedron. Energy differences should be 0.1-0.5 eV between preferred and non-preferred geometries. Successful calculation confirms Kepert model predictions. Failed calculation shows different energy ordering or negligible energy differences (<0.05 eV).'


- claim: "The mechanism for recombination of a pair of anti-sites, BrPb + PbBr, to a null (perfect) crystal, follows a concerted-exchange pathway. This recombination mechanism is quite energetically affordable for the crystal, with a Ea value of 0.335 eV."
  instruction: '1. Required input files: CsPbBr3 supercell with BrPb and PbBr anti-site defect pair, NEB parameters for concerted motion, formation energy data.
    
    2. Create initial configuration with BrPb anti-site (Br atom on Pb site) and PbBr anti-site (Pb atom on Br site) in proximity.
    
    3. Design final state showing perfect crystal with both atoms in correct lattice positions.
    
    4. Set up NEB pathway for concerted exchange where both atoms simultaneously move toward correct positions.
    
    5. Include intermediate states showing vacancy-interstitial character during the exchange process.
    
    6. Run NEB calculation to determine migration energy Em for the concerted exchange.
    
    7. Calculate activation energy Ea = Ef + Em using formation energies of the anti-site pair.
    
    8. Expected output: Converged NEB pathway showing concerted atomic exchange with Ea = 0.335 eV (±0.05 eV). Pathway should show intermediate vacancy-interstitial states. Successful run demonstrates energetically feasible recombination mechanism. Failed run shows much higher activation energy (>0.5 eV) or non-physical exchange pathway.'


- claim: "Both BrPb and PbBr undergo slight displacements from their anti-site positions, effectively generating vacancies at their original sites. These displacements simultaneously give rise to interstitial configurations (Bri and Pbi), marking an intermediate stage of the process."
  instruction: '1. Required input files: NEB pathway data for anti-site recombination, structural analysis tools for vacancy/interstitial identification.
    
    2. Extract intermediate structures from the anti-site recombination NEB pathway, particularly around the transition state region.
    
    3. Analyze atomic positions relative to ideal lattice sites to identify vacancy formation.
    
    4. Track displacement of BrPb and PbBr atoms from their initial anti-site positions during the exchange.
    
    5. Identify intermediate configurations where displaced atoms adopt interstitial-like positions.
    
    6. Verify simultaneous presence of vacancy character (empty lattice sites) and interstitial character (off-lattice positions).
    
    7. Map the progression: anti-sites → vacancy+interstitial intermediate → perfect lattice.
    
    8. Expected output: Intermediate NEB images show BrPb and PbBr atoms displaced from lattice sites creating vacancy-interstitial character before reaching final perfect positions. Successful analysis identifies clear intermediate stage with mixed defect character. Failed analysis shows direct exchange without identifiable vacancy-interstitial intermediate states.'


- claim: "When the vacancy is not the closest neighbor to the interstitial, the 'domino effect' strategy appears to facilitate this migration as well. We see that, for an interstitial to migrate, having one more intermediate atom involved reduced the migration barrier. Adding a second intermediate atom reduced this barrier almost to zero."
  instruction: '1. Required input files: CsPbBr3 supercell with Br interstitial and Br vacancy separated by multiple lattice sites, NEB parameters for multi-atom pathways.
    
    2. Set up three different migration scenarios: (a) direct jump from interstitial to non-nearest neighbor vacancy, (b) pathway with one intermediate Br atom, (c) pathway with two intermediate Br atoms.
    
    3. Design NEB pathways where intermediate atoms participate in concerted motion toward the vacancy.
    
    4. Run NEB calculations for all three scenarios to obtain migration energy barriers.
    
    5. Compare migration energies: direct jump > one intermediate > two intermediates.
    
    6. Verify that two-intermediate pathway approaches near-zero migration barrier (<0.05 eV).
    
    7. Analyze energy profiles to confirm progressive barrier reduction with additional intermediate atoms.
    
    8. Expected output: Migration energies showing clear reduction: Em(direct) > Em(1-intermediate) > Em(2-intermediate) ≈ 0 eV. Two-intermediate pathway should show migration barrier ≤ 0.05 eV. Successful run demonstrates progressive barrier lowering. Failed run shows no systematic reduction or non-zero barrier for two-intermediate case.'


- claim: "Considering the activation energies of halide interstitials, we note that the charged system pathway sits at a very slightly more energetically preferred position relative to the neutral pathway for Em. As a result, when Ef and Em are summed to determine the activation energy, Ea values for charged and neutral Br interstitials are very similar."

    4. Calculate activation energies Ea = Ef + Em for both charge states using equation (3).
    
    5. Compare Ea values between neutral (0.79-1.17 eV) and charged (0.85-1.29 eV) systems.
    
    6. Verify that charged pathways show slightly lower Em values than neutral pathways.
    
    7. Confirm that despite formation energy differences, final activation energies are similar between charge states.
    
    8. Expected output: Ea(neutral) = 0.79-1.17 eV and Ea(charged) = 0.85-1.29 eV showing overlapping ranges and similar values. Em(charged) < Em(neutral) demonstrating energetic preference for charged migration. Successful calculation shows comparable activation energies despite formation energy differences. Failed calculation shows significantly different Ea values (>0.3 eV difference) between charge states.'


- claim: "These results clearly indicate that the most favorable migration pathway amongst the ones we studied features a collective and concerted movement of several atoms, consistent with the interstitial 'domino effect' in vacancy-assisted migration."

    2. Compare migration energies across all calculated pathways: individual defect migrations, split interstitials, domino effect pathways.
    
    3. Identify pathways involving collective/concerted atomic motion versus single-atom migrations.
    
    4. Extract lowest migration energy values from domino effect calculations (approaching zero from previous claims).
    
    5. Compare with single-atom migration energies for Br interstitials (0.20-0.54 eV neutral, 0.19-0.41 eV charged).
    
    6. Verify that split interstitial migrations show lower barriers than individual interstitials.
    
    7. Confirm that multi-atom concerted pathways represent the most energetically favorable mechanisms.

Successful analysis demonstrates clear energetic hierarchy favoring concerted motion. Failed analysis shows individual pathways as energetically competitive with or better than concerted mechanisms.'
