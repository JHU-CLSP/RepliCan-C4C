    - "Extract intermediate structures from the anti-site recombination NEB pathway, particularly around the transition state region."
    - "Analyze atomic positions relative to ideal lattice sites to identify vacancy formation."
    - "Track displacement of BrPb and PbBr atoms from their initial anti-site positions during the exchange."
    - "Identify intermediate configurations where displaced atoms adopt interstitial-like positions."
    - "Verify simultaneous presence of vacancy character (empty lattice sites) and interstitial character (off-lattice positions)."
    - "Map the progression: anti-sites → vacancy+interstitial intermediate → perfect lattice."
    - "Expected output: Intermediate NEB images show BrPb and PbBr atoms displaced from lattice sites creating vacancy-interstitial character before reaching final perfect positions. Successful analysis identifies clear intermediate stage with mixed defect character. Failed analysis shows direct exchange without identifiable vacancy-interstitial intermediate states."

- claim: "When the vacancy is not the closest neighbor to the interstitial, the 'domino effect' strategy appears to facilitate this migration as well. We see that, for an interstitial to migrate, having one more intermediate atom involved reduced the migration barrier. Adding a second intermediate atom reduced this barrier almost to zero."
  instruction:
    - "Required input files: CsPbBr3 supercell with Br interstitial and Br vacancy separated by multiple lattice sites, NEB parameters for multi-atom pathways."
    - "Set up three different migration scenarios: (a) direct jump from interstitial to non-nearest neighbor vacancy, (b) pathway with one intermediate Br atom, (c) pathway with two intermediate Br atoms."
    - "Design NEB pathways where intermediate atoms participate in concerted motion toward the vacancy."
    - "Run NEB calculations for all three scenarios to obtain migration energy barriers."
    - "Compare migration energies: direct jump > one intermediate > two intermediates."
    - "Verify that two-intermediate pathway approaches near-zero migration barrier (<0.05 eV)."
    - "Analyze energy profiles to confirm progressive barrier reduction with additional intermediate atoms."
    - "Expected output: Migration energies showing clear reduction: Em(direct) > Em(1-intermediate) > Em(2-intermediate) ≈ 0 eV. Two-intermediate pathway should show migration barrier ≤ 0.05 eV. Successful run demonstrates progressive barrier lowering. Failed run shows no systematic reduction or non-zero barrier for two-intermediate case."

- claim: "Considering the activation energies of halide interstitials, we note that the charged system pathway sits at a very slightly more energetically preferred position relative to the neutral pathway for Em. As a result, when Ef and Em are summed to determine the activation energy, Ea values for charged and neutral Br interstitials are very similar."
  instruction:
    - "Required input files: Formation and migration energy data for both neutral and charged Br interstitials, Table 1 reference values."

    - "Calculate activation energies Ea = Ef + Em for both charge states using equation (3)."
    - "Compare Ea values between neutral (0.79-1.17 eV) and charged (0.85-1.29 eV) systems."
    - "Verify that charged pathways show slightly lower Em values than neutral pathways."
    - "Confirm that despite formation energy differences, final activation energies are similar between charge states."
    - "Expected output: Ea(neutral) = 0.79-1.17 eV and Ea(charged) = 0.85-1.29 eV showing overlapping ranges and similar values. Em(charged) < Em(neutral) demonstrating energetic preference for charged migration. Successful calculation shows comparable activation energies despite formation energy differences. Failed calculation shows significantly different Ea values (>0.3 eV difference) between charge states."

- claim: "These results clearly indicate that the most favorable migration pathway amongst the ones we studied features a collective and concerted movement of several atoms, consistent with the interstitial 'domino effect' in vacancy-assisted migration."
  instruction:
    - "Required input files: Migration energy data from Table 1 for all defect types, NEB pathway analysis for concerted vs individual atom movements."
    - "Compare migration energies across all calculated pathways: individual defect migrations, split interstitials, domino effect pathways."
    - "Identify pathways involving collective/concerted atomic motion versus single-atom migrations."
    - "Extract lowest migration energy values from domino effect calculations (approaching zero from previous claims)."
    - "Compare with single-atom migration energies for Br interstitials (0.20-0.54 eV neutral, 0.19-0.41 eV charged)."
    - "Verify that split interstitial migrations show lower barriers than individual interstitials."
    - "Confirm that multi-atom concerted pathways represent the most energetically favorable mechanisms."
    - "Expected output: Domino effect pathways show lowest migration barriers (≤0.05 eV), split interstitials show intermediate values (0.02-0.37 eV), individual migrations show highest barriers (0.19-0.54 eV). Successful analysis demonstrates clear energetic hierarchy favoring concerted motion. Failed analysis shows individual pathways as energetically competitive with or better than concerted mechanisms."
