        "Run Eval23.ipynb. The notebook plots the number of grains as a function of simulation time for three independent trials, producing two panels: the left panel corresponds to ice without ice-nucleating proteins (INPs), and the right panel corresponds to ice with INPs",
        "Verify that, in the left panel, the number of grains remains approximately constant over time across all trials, whereas in the right panel the number of grains exhibits a clear decreasing trend with simulation time."
